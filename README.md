# eclipse-prolog-tools

This repo contains a bunch tools for [ECLiPSe](https://eclipseclp.org/),
including a formatter derived from the `pretty_printer` library

See my [neovim config](https://github.com/3akev/lazyvim/blob/main/lua/plugins/prolog.lua) for an example of how to integrate it with neovim.
Also, shameless plug, check out my [nvim plugin](https://github.com/3akev/ecl.nvim) for an easier time with ECLiPSe.
